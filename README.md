I'm a political science professor at UNLV. I study courts, politics, and pretty much whatever else I feel like studying. I love teaching research methods classes. My favorite is when my grad students go out into the world and save democracy with data! These days, I'm working on some exciting projects about the Nevada Legislature, perceptions of legitimacy of state courts, and way too many more.
